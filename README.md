## Project Overview
- **Purpose**: A web app that fetches and displays YouTube video details based on a given URL. The app currently retrieves the video title and description using the YouTube Data API.
- **Public URL**: [https://youtube-insights-sandy.vercel.app/](https://youtube-insights-sandy.vercel.app/)

## Steps Completed

   - Created a `vercel.json` file for custom deployment settings.
   - Successfully deployed to Vercel with the public URL.

3. **Tested the Deployment**:

## Next Steps (Planned)
1. **Enhance Features**:
   - **Add Video Statistics**: Include additional data points like views, likes, comments, etc.
   - **NLP-Based Summaries**: Implement Natural Language Processing to generate summaries for video descriptions or comments.

2. **Improve the User Interface**:
   - Use a front-end framework like **Bootstrap** to make the app visually appealing.
   - Enhance the layout for a more user-friendly experience.

3. **Set Up a Custom Domain**:
   - If you have a custom domain, link it to your Vercel project for a personalized URL.
